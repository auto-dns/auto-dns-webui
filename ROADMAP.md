DNS Records UI Redesign ‚Äì Context Snapshot (June 2025)
Overall Goals:

Modern, clean UI for DNS record viewer with powerful but intuitive filtering/sorting

Mobile and desktop UX tailored separately

Prioritize common real-world use cases: quick lookup > sorting > advanced filtering

‚úÖ Layout Paradigm
Mobile:

Sticky top bar with global search (searches all fields)

Hamburger icon opens slide-in modal for filters and sort

Sort + filters are secondary (hidden by default)

Desktop:

Sticky top bar with global search only

Hamburger icon opens a left sidebar for filters and sort (persistent or toggleable)

Optionally modal-based filter/sort panel is acceptable if better UX

‚úÖ Sorting UX
Default sort = dnsRecord.name, ascending

Use chips for active sort criteria:

[Record Name ‚Üë ‚úï] [Host ‚Üì ‚úï] [+ Add]

Clicking chip opens modal to edit sort field + direction

Clicking ‚úï removes that sort level

+ Add button opens modal with remaining available sort fields

‚úÖ Filtering UX
Use pill-style selectable chips (not plain checkboxes)

Organize filters into logical groups (Record Type, Hostname, etc.)

Style filters as cards in a grid layout (on desktop)

Support text input filters (e.g. container name) with unified styling

‚úÖ Component Plan
TopBar.tsx: sticky bar with search and filter toggle

FilterSortDrawer.tsx: filter/sort sidebar (desktop) or modal (mobile)

SortChips.tsx: chip UI for displaying/modifying current sort

SortModal.tsx: modal for adding/editing sort levels

StyledFacet.tsx: pill-style multi-select input for filters

üß† Design Principles
Search-first, filter/sort secondary

Clean visual hierarchy and spacing

Avoid clunky native elements (unstyled checkboxes, selects)

Responsive and unified UX between mobile and desktop
